# Interceptor 


#### This is an original game idea in which the user is the commander of an island's arsenal and attempting to defend the island from incoming missiles. It is a new style of the classic ATARI game Missile Command.

#### The game uses object-oriented programming, randomised numbers and the pygame game engine in order to draw things to the screen. 
#### -The island is randomly generated and will change every time the game is booted.
#### -The incoming missiles operate on a random principle
#### -The interceptor missiles also fire on random trajectories but improve as time goes on.
#### -If the user is to use their missiles too quickly, they will be left defenceless.
